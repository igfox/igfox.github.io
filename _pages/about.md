I work as a Research Scientist at Facebook Applied AI Research, where I strive to see if [Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ReAgent){:target="_blank"} can be used for anything particularly practical.

In the before-times, I received a PhD from the University of Michigan. I spent my time there under [Jenna Wiens](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~wiensj/){:target="_blank"} in the [MLD3](https://wiens-group.engin.umich.edu/){:target="_blank"} lab. My research centered around developing machine learning algorithms to improve the treatment of type 1 diabetes.
